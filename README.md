# Discussion-Forum
This repository contains source code of Discussion Forum which have been developed under Webkriti competition of AASF.

# Basic Layout of site
The hierarchy of this site is in following order: Categories -> Subcategories -> Topics(Questions).
User need to first register his account which will be followed by verification from Admin, after which only he can successfully login. User has the right to ask a new question or browse through the pre-existing questions under a particular category. He can also upvote the comments made by other user or delete his own comments. 
Categories and subcategories can only be created by Admin of this site, otherwise it would make a state of chaos if each user add a new category every time.
